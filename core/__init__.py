# mon_bot_social/core/__init__.py
# This file can be empty. It's used to mark the 'core' directory as a Python package.

# You could potentially import key classes here if you want to make them 
# directly accessible via from core import AppManager, etc.
# For example:
# from .app_manager import AppManager
# from .session_manager import SessionManager
# from .task_scheduler import TaskScheduler

# However, it's often cleaner to keep __init__.py files minimal or empty
# and let modules explicitly import what they need from specific submodules.
