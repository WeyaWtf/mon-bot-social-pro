# mon_bot_social/automation_engine/actions/__init__.py
# This file makes the 'actions' directory a Python package.

# You can optionally import all your action classes here to make them 
# accessible more easily, e.g.:
# from .follow_action import FollowAction
# from .like_action import LikeAction
# from .comment_action import CommentAction
# from .unfollow_action import UnfollowAction
# from .view_story_action import ViewStoryAction
# from .gather_action import GatherAction
# from .accept_follow_request_action import AcceptFollowRequestAction
# from .direct_message_action import DirectMessageAction
# from .check_new_followers_action import CheckNewFollowersAction

# Then, from other parts of the project, you could do:
# from automation_engine.actions import FollowAction
# instead of:
# from automation_engine.actions.follow_action import FollowAction

# For now, keeping it empty is also perfectly fine and often preferred to avoid
# circular dependencies if actions were to import from each other through this __init__.
